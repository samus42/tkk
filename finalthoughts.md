# Battleborn Taken King Guide
## Final Thoughts

You want to get better?  Become an elite raider? Then listen close...um...sorry.  Read close.  That just doesn't sound as good.

### Volunteer
You can complete this raid avoiding most duties.  If you're lucky on the Daughters, you can even avoid jumping.  However you're missing out on a lot of fun, and it weakens any team you're on.  Start getting comfortable with running the relic, taking the gaze, jumping platforms, etc.  You'll probably screw it up, but remember this: **You are part of Battleborn**.  We're ok with screw ups, as long as you're trying.  

*If you're not part of Battleborn, and you are with people who don't like it when people screw up, find different people.*

**Q: Wait a minute!  I went on a raid with you and you specifically said you weren't taking Golgoroth's gaze!  Are you a hypocrite?**

**A:** I took the gaze for 3 months straight because I never had a Black Spindle.  My Black Spindle is now 320 and I want to play with it, so shut up.

### Practice, Practice, Practice
A lot of the bosses allow you to play around in the arena before things start off.  Do practice runs where you have to jump or move to certain areas.  Especially for the Golgoroth challenge.  

If you're not great at jumping platforms, then ask to do a couple runs at Daughters/Oryx before you kill them.

Above all, if you screw something up, try again immediately.  Don't give up!

### Talky Talky
This raid is all about communication.  Teams that don't communicate fail often, and frustratingly so.  Even if you know what you're doing, communicating with others is still key.  It's a good idea to have someone "call cadence" on parts of the raid where there are steps to do.  i.e. Calling out the steps of transfering gaze on the Golgoroth challenge.  When everyone knows what is going on, the stress level drops, and people have more fun.

### Weapons
Learn to use your sniper rifle.  This raid really pushes you towards it as all the bosses seems to have a weakness against it.  

Auto rifles will be frustrating to use unless you've got a high stability.  Also you'll be engaging a lot of enemies at range, so the range drop off of auto rifles will really hit you.

The raid Heavy Machine Gun is pretty much the most useful raid weapon.  Turn it on a wizard and watch it melt.  It's pretty stable and has decent impact so can be used at all phases.

**Q: What about my sidearm?**

**A:** Go away.

### Mix It Up
Have some fun with the raid!  Give yourself different goals you want to hit!  Some examples:

* Jester Challenge: If you fall on the ship puzzle, you must sing a song.  If you are singing and your teammates ask you to stop, sing louder.  Bonus points for getting others to sing along.
* Speed Run: How fast can you do the raid?  Look for ways to speed up each section and try to beat your time.
* Raid Randomizer: I've written a [raid role randomizer](http://www.faier.net/scott/tkk-random/index.html) that will layout what everyone's role is at every step of the raid.  Use this to mix things up if you're always doing the same thing.

**Q: This guide sucks**

**A:** That wasn't a question.  Shut up and go write your own guide.
