## Golgoroth's Maze

This actually isn't much of a maze as there aren't many wrong turns you can take.  The darkness can be a problem, as well as the pits scattered throughout.  The pits don't mess you up so much from the deaths, as leaving yourself completely disoriented when you resurrect.

What you need to realize is that in this place there are no actual 'turns', every intersection is a 4 way.  Where there would normally be a corner is an intersection with 2 dead ends a couple of yards in.  So if you miss you'll hit a wall in a couple of seconds. Your ghost can be helpful here, when you activating the radar pulse can help you see the pits, as well as giving you a bit more light.  

As a general rule though, if there is an intersection, there's probably a pit.  So you're safest jumping through an intersection rather than just running.

The way through the maze is pretty simple:
1. At the first intersection, turn right
2. At the next corner intersection, turn left
3. At the next corner intersection, turn left
4. At the next intersection turn right
5. Go straight until you fall into the pit that's right after the maze seems to end.
6. After getting resurrected, continue going straight to a door that will open once everyone else makes it through.

See? No problem!

**Q: Wait a second! Isn't there a chest here?"**

**A:** Well...yes, but are you sure you want it?

**Q: GIMME THE CHEST!!!**
**A:** Ok...but I warned you....

### The Secret Chest
At intersection 4 in the above steps, if you turn left, there is a door which opens to give you a secret chest.  However to open the door you need to stand on 4 plates in the maze, in order.

I want to give a quick shout out to the early people who discovered this.  Some of these plates are **very** difficult to see.  It must have taken a very long time to figure this out.  Kudos.

I'll give the directions to each plate from the entrance.
#### Plate A
1. At the first intersection, turn left.
2. At the corner intersection, turn left.
3. At the end is the plate, as well as a Calcified Fragment hidden in the back corner.

#### Plate B
1. At the first intersection, turn right.
2. At the corner intersection, turn right.
3. The plate is near the wall.

#### Plate C
1. At the first intersection, turn right.
2. At the next corner intersection, turn left.
3. At the next corner intersection, turn left.
4. At the next intersection, turn right.
5. At the next intersection, turn right (if you hit the chandelier, you've gone too far)
6. At the corner intersection, turn right.
7. You'll hit a rock formation, the plate is on the other side.  Stay on this side of the rock until it's time to jump on the plate.

#### Plate D
1. At the first intersection, turn right.
2. At the next corner intersection, turn left.
3. At the next corner intersection, turn left.
4. At the next intersection, keep going straight.
5. At the next intersection you *would* go left.  Except some prick put a door there.  If you use your ghost, you should see the outline of a hole *above* the door.  The best place to jump into the hole is from the back right of the intersection (facing the hole).  A warlock is really the best for this, with all the floaty floaty they can do.

Ok, now everyone has found a plate, you have to step on them in order.  The order is:
D, B, A, C

The person on plate C when looking towards the entrance will see everyone name tags, so usually let that person call out who's on next.

Once that's all done, meet up at the door and claim your reward that took people days to figure out.

**Q: WTF?!?!?!??!?!!??!!?!?**
**A:** What, you didn't want more shards?  I did warn you...

Ok, straight down the corridor and we're ready to take on [Golgoroth](./golgoroth.html)
