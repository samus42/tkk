# Battleborn Taken King Guide
## Golgoroth (Challenge Mode)

You've had a good life.  Each time you get to Golgoroth you've always got some schmuck taking gaze for you while you just hop into the pit and blast away.  I bet you never think about the mental trauma the gaze puller goes through.  Well guess what?  Now its your turn to suffer as well!  The challenge is **everyone must take the gaze every damage round**.

**Q: You mean if everyone gets the gaze once, we're good?**

**A:** No, I mean *every damage round*.  When someone hits him in the back, everyone else must have captured gaze before his back closes.

**Q: What if someone dies?  Can we skip them?**

**A:** No.  If someone dies, then you do another damage round, you will not complete the challenge.  The exception is if someone dies and you kill Golgoroth before his back closes.  Then its fine.

To do this challenge, you need:
* 6 people who can count.
* Someone who likes to talk in a calm voice.
* 2 people who handle stress really well.

Everyone is going to get a number, #1 & #2 should follow the same rules as the normal run. Your #3 should be someone who can pay attention to time.  #4, #5, & #6 should be your heaviest hitters *(i.e. the people with the 320 Black Spindles)*.

Here's how its going to work:
1. Odds on the right hand side, evens on the left.
2. #1 takes the first gaze from the right bridge, just like a normal run
3. #2 takes the gaze from the left corner and everyone gets in the pit.
4. #2 needs to make sure to start counting down at 12, if #2 needs to whimper while counting, that is acceptable.
5. At 10 seconds, #3 leaves the pit and runs to the bridge where #1 took the first gaze.
6. When the count reaches 2 seconds, #3 needs to take the gaze.
7. Everyone jumps out of the pit when the gaze is taken by #3.  #1 & #5 needs to run to the right bridge.  #4 & #6 to the left corner.
8. As soon as the back opens, #4 takes the gaze.
9. As soon as the back opens, #5 takes the gaze.  **#1 & #3 need to defend #5 as adds will be swarming at that time**.
10. As soon as the back opens, #6 takes the gaze and holds it for the full count.  Odds go back to their corner and work on baddies in the pit.

**Bonus Hint:** When you get the Corrupted Light, instead of jumping out of pit, stand next to Golgoroth.  When you blow up you'll hurt him instead.  Since he'll always have his gaze captured, he won't stomp on you.

**Second Bonus Hint:** Appoint someone with a calm voice to call out the sequence. i.e. "#4 in position, #4 take gaze, #5 in position", etc etc.

**Q: I'm watching #6 get killed by the orbs.  What should I tell him to do?**

**A:** Are you helping kill orbs?

**Q: No, of course not, why would I?**

**A:** Absolutely right, unfortunately your best bet is to quit your fireteam immediately and go find random people to play with.  I'm sure you'll be missed.

The #1 reason people fail this is people dying, so exercise constructive cowardice.  Duck behind cover if you get hit, and leave the pit early if the Cursed Thralls or Taken get too close.

Keep calm, help your partners with orbs, and you'll be getting your sweet 320 loot.
