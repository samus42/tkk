# Battleborn Taken King Guide
## The Portal Room

You start in a familiar area, in the Court of the Taken King. Immediately you think, "Finally!  I can use these runes for something useful!".  No.  Sorry.

First notice the Tomb Husks to the left and right....Actually forget that.  From this point off we will no longer call them Tomb Husks.  We shall call them orbs.  Because that's what they are, and no one likes yelling **"GOT THE TOMB HUSK"**.

OK, first notice the orbs on the left and right.  They're not there for decoration which is just as well because they went way overboard on the greenish brown decor anyway.  You'll need 2 brave volunteers (*suckers*) to pick them up. Once that happens a glass wall will come between you and those statues.

*At this point someone should say "Schiess dem fenster".  If no one chuckles afterwards, the person who said it is allowed to berate the person for not remembering Die Hard, or even worse, not seeing it.  If there is someone who hasn't seen it, end the raid and transition to the Battleborn Guide to watching Die Hard coming soon.*

Shoot the glass.  Kill the bad guys behind the glass.  Go over to the statue that is holding an orb and slam it home.  You should be a bit ashamed you needed me to tell you that.

So....you slammed the orb.  No portal yet.  No other orbs.....so do we just wait?  Maybe the portal is being run by Comcast so it's a bit slow?

Well as much as I'd love to blame Comcast, in this case the orbs HAVE come back, but they're outside the room.  One to the left, one to the right.  At this point you'll need to split into three teams.
* One going to the right
* One going to the left
* One staying in the middle

Good thing you have this guide right?

We'll start with the people in the middle.  Their jobs is to stay in the middle and kill things and break glass.  Glass will come up again in the middle each round, and over the doors to the right and left.  So make sure they like breaking things.  Neat freaks should not be in the middle.  Also people who can't handle change should stay in the middle since they do the same thing every time.

Ok, people on the left and right.  You have two roles, one person to grab the orb. The other person to be a defender and kill things.  If you have a neat freak, grabbing the orb and putting it away is probably for them.  There will be more glass to break over the doorway, so make sure the orb carrier isn't looking when the defender does so.  

As you come out to the balcony, you'll notice a bridge connecting with the next area.  As a defender, you will never step on that bridge.  That's wrong.  You stay on the balcony.  **STAY**. Good boy.

Now what's going to happen is that the orb is going to get farther and farther away each round.  This is because Orxy doesn't want to get beat by flabby Guardians.  So get running people!  

When the carrier picks up the orb, the defender breaks the glass (again, make sure you do it fast so the orb carrier doesn't see it) and starts killing the Phalanxes that come out before they blast the carrier off the bridge.  And trust me if the defender doesn't at least distract them, the orb carrier is going to say very nasty things to the defender.

I want to call out the 2nd round, because for that round the orb floats in midair above the chasm.  Warlocks and Titan have no problem here, double jump and grab it.  Feel free to look smug.  Hunters....will swear a lot.  Hunters, I get it.  You don't get a nice float/glide.  You're arcing in the air, and there's NO WAY you'll hang around that orb long enough for the circle to completely go around and grant you the orb.  But fear not, there is one piece of information you need to know.  *The circle doesn't need to go all the way around while you press the button to get the orb*.  

Blows your mind right?!  They don't even pay attention to their own mechanics!  

So Hunters what you do is turn on triple jump (which you honestly should have had on anyway), double jump towards the orb, then right before you get there hit your 3rd jump and hold down the square button.  

You will now of course fall into the chasm because you didn't line up your jump correctly to land on the other side, but don't worry, you have time to try 2 or 3 more times.

The thing about this part of the raid is that it actually gets *easier* as it goes along.  Yes the orb bearer has to run further, but that gives the defender and center people more time to kill the adds that could get in their way.  Dying and having to go back for the orb is much slower than running further.  

Besides, you *probably* need the exercise...

 There you have it, what could go wrong?

 ### What could go wrong
 #### Orb bearer gets too close to the statue area when the centurions are still alive.
 Did you know that the Centurions were Jedi?  Doubt me? Then stand around the corner to the statue area with the orb and wait.  In a couple of seconds an axion bolt will come around the corner and blast you into oblivion.  He never saw you, so he must be a Jedi.  Who knew?

 #### Defender focuses on the adds before the door
 Not as critical on round 4 on, but on the early rounds the defender needs to get that door open.  The orb bearer has no room to maneuver, so blast that door open (with sword, shotgun, etc) and wave them through.

**Q: Who should carry the orbs?**

**A:** People who can't hit a large wall of glass.

**Q: I'm in front of the statue with my orb, yet the other runner isn't there yet.  Can I slam it anyway?**

**A:** You're an impatient one aren't you?  You probably start eating your dinner right away and can't be bothered to wait for your mother who slaved in a hot kitchen all day to get food for herself.  You probably finish and give a loud belch before she even sits down.  You insensitive prick! Wait, what was the question again?  Oh right, the orbs need to be slammed within 3 seconds of each other.  So no, you can't slam it.

### Moving on
You'll notice the portal in front of you opens, so sprint to it as fast as you can and pass through it.  It won't work, you'll come out on the other side of the platform, but don't worry, this is a good thing!  This fools all the baddies coming out that it's a one way portal.  So when you turn around and try again, the baddies all think you're one of the best hide and seek players of all time.  But you're not.  That title belongs to my brother who hid from his parents for 6 hours.  That's dedication.

Anyway

After all that running, you're ready to grab your first chest!  Go ahead, grab it!

**AFTER THE FIRE GOES OUT YOU IDIOT**

For god's sake.  OK, NOW grab it.  

**Q: WTF?!?!?!?!!?**

**A:** What? You don't like Mouldering Shards?

**Q: Why would I want those?**

**A:** If you collect 20 of them, when you beat the raid, you'll lose them and have the chance to get an exotic.

**Q: A good chance?**

**A:** Um.......no

**Q: WTF?!?!?!!?!??!?!**

**A**: TF

Let's just move on, to the [infamous ship puzzle](./shippuzzle.html).
