# Battleborn Taken King Guide
## The Relay Race (Cheese Style!)

OK, so you're tired of all that running back and forth.  Or maybe you've having issues with basic concepts like leaving the plate when you have the Deathsinger's Power.  And you cry to the heavens, "Surely there is another way!".  Well a voice has responded, "Yes there is, and don't call me Shirley!"

To this date I don't know if this is a glitch or not.  The conditions that cause it to happen seem to be so out there, that I wonder if its intentional. To make this cheese work you need two people who fit the following criteria
1. Have swords
2. Handle stress really really well
3. Have Red Deaths (especially on the right hand side)

So here's how the cheese work, have your volunteers walking into their respective poison room and start blocking with their swords.  You'll see them flicker as they slowly drain ammo.  Around 8 times or so, suddenly the flickering will increase.  At this point in time have them leave the poison room **while continuing to block**.  Once they've left, then can stop blocking.  Now have them re-enter the poison room.  Notice their health is **not** going down? They are now immune until they leave the poison room again.

This means that **they can stay on the side plate the whole time!**.

Your setup is now different, one person on each side standing on the plate. The other 4 in the center, broken into teams of two that pass the orb between themselves and stand on the center plate.

No running back and forth to the plate, get the power, get drained, get back in the bubble and trade.  

For the four people in the center, this is much easier.  They can concentrate on killing Thralls, Wizards, and Knights. As long as they are not idiots, brand transfer goes off without a hitch.  And if it doesn't?  You just wait for the orb to come back and continue on without having to worry about wiping.  You can even suffer a death and trade off between the three that are left.  Heck you can do it with two alive in the middle.

Life in the middle is pretty damn good.

You people standing on the side plates?  You're life is about to suck a lot (hence the need to handle stress very well).

### Why your life is about to suck
#### You have to kill every balcony Knight and you have no timer to tell you when they come out.
This can be helped by the people in the middle giving you a warning when there are 4 seconds left or so except...
#### The people in the middle will forget to tell you.  Or they'll miss a brand transfer which makes the counter worthless.
At this point you'll need to have a good internal clock or keep glancing up at the balcony.
#### It NEVER lets up.  
The Acolytes just keep coming.  The balcony Knight keeps coming out, and you do **not** have a break.  You do not get to run anywhere, or stand around on the center plate waiting.  You will be moving and shooting **constantly**.
#### Adds will get through
And it's going to piss you off.  If a Knight gets through, you might throw your controller at the wall (which you shouldn't they are expensive).
#### The balcony Knight will turn is back to you
For some reason he wants to face the people in the middle.  Up to the point you need to take your eye off him for a second to take care of an Acolyte.  Then he'll spin and nail you.
#### Right hand side has *no* cover
Only people who can handle stress **really** well should take the right and side.
#### No running means almost no ammo recovery
Popping a synth will be one of the most stressful things you do.  Running out of special ammo will really hurt here.
#### It's all on you
Notice no jokes in this section?  No smart ass remarks? That's how serious this is.  If you die, it's pretty much over.

### How your life can suck less
#### Red Death
This gun will give you a second wind, do not underestimate it.
#### Running off your plate...briefly
You can leave your plate for about 5 seconds, so if you see ammo in front of you after you've killed the balcony Knight, go get it.  Try to do it right after the knight though, or you'll have a nice surprise when you return.  Ignore the people in the middle who complain about their super draining.
#### Telling your people to let a couple of Thralls through.
Thralls come right to the plate, so they're great ammo delivery vessels.  And if you're expecting it, you can probably juggle. Feel free to scream at your team when they let through Thralls you didn't ask for though.

### How people in the center can make life better
#### Nothing gets through (unless asked for)
Remember that scene in Return of the Jedi where the Admiral says "Increase forward firepower, I don't want anything to get through"?  Well it's just like that, but this time *don't* let an A-Wing take out the bridge.

#### Don't miss an orb transfer
Not only does it mean your side plate person will be there longer, but now you've lost the timer.  And frankly, the space between the center plate and the person with the brand is *10 yards*.  If you miss it you should wear the cone of shame!

#### Count down the brand timer from 5 seconds
Not only does this remind your partner it's time to take the orb, it gives the person on the side plate a chance to get ready for the balcony Knight.

#### Mute the side place people
Seriously, you can't do anything else to help them, and they're just going to spend the whole time whining and whimpering.  You need to concentrate

#### Buy your side plate person a beer
They deserve it.

OK, hopefully you've made it through, and are ready to [kill the Warpriest](./warpriest.html)
