# Battleborn Taken King Guide
## The Ship Puzzle

All righty, flush with the bounty of that wonderful chest, it's time to move onward.  

*For Hunters Only:
You should put on your Bones of Ao now.  It doesn't matter if it's a Year 1 Bones.  You want them on.  The other people reading this guide?  They're going to have problems.  You will not.  You will breeze through this.  Make sure you're smug the whole time.  You deserve it.*

The first *challenge* you will come across is a set of swinging pendulums.  Hunters can bounce through them, wizards can float through them.  Titans will crash and burn the first time through.  You see, the pendulums are curved except at the very middle, so that wonderful Titan glide will actually go downwards instead of up.  Make sure you jump from the middle of the plate.  You'll go slower, but don't worry about the ribbing from your fellow Guardians.  They're going to be begging for your help real soon now (i.e. in 2 chapters).

After running through a hallway (where you can and should play around by jumping on the ships), you'll come to a dead end with some baddies that you can kill if you feel like it.  Notice the ship.  Jump on it.

**Q: Jump on a ship? Are you sure? That seems wrong.**

**A:** Let me get this straight, you're attempting to kill someone who wiped out a whole fleet with 6 people and you think **this** feels wrong?

Now remember those runs in the Vault of the Glass?  You decided, "Hell with the warping platforms, on the 3rd platform I'll just jump for the wall".  Well the bad guys were paying attention.  No cheesing this jumping challenge.  You only have yourself to blame.
From here on out, when I'm giving directions, it's always relative to the direction the ship is traveling.

**Q: The ship moves?!**

**A:** You're quick aren't you.

Look forward and too the right, see that ship in the distance?  You're not jumping to that one. Look behind you on the right hand side.  That's your ship.  Wait until it's decently close then hop on.  Warlocks, be careful not to jump too high or you'll die when you drop and land on the ship.  This might not make a lot of sense, but you have to realize the top of the ships are more solid than other solid things you've landed on.  Bring a microscope on your next run, you'll see it.

Now look in front of you and too the right, that's your next ship.  It comes close enough that you don't have to jump, you can just lazily drop onto it.

The next one is coming from the front left.  They don't give you a lot of time for this one, so don't take in the scenery.

*Normal mode:
There will be a platform to your left, if you jump on it, you will get a checkpoint.  Wimp.*

Appearing next to you on the right hand side is your next ship, and you get a little rest as you ride this for a bit.  The next ship will appear right in front of you, at which point things get tricky.

First off get on the back left part of the ship, so you're as high as possible.  There will be a ship coming from your left that crosses over.  **You do not want that ship**.  Wait for the next one that crosses from the right hand side.  Warlocks and Titans do quick double tap jump to get max height to get on top of it.  Hunters, if you don't have Bones of Ao, this can be incredibly tough to time correctly.  Use triple jump and try to get max height to make it on. **This is the hardest jump in the whole raid**.

Did you make it?  Great!  It's easy from here on out.  The next ship comes towards you from in front, then the next one is in front of that going from left to right.  Finally, the last ship is a bit below you and too your right that you ride all the way up to the far platform.  There will be a welcoming committee waiting for you, make sure you have your guest gift of lots of bullets ready to go.

**Q: I keep missing that jump, and my fireteam is already across.  What do I do?**

**A:** OK, the great thing here is as long as 3 people make it across, they can pull everyone else through.  So what you want to do is say "Hey, my wife has been yelling at me.  I'll be back in a minute, just pull me through."  That way it isn't obvious that you can't make the jump, you're just distracted.  I'll vouch for you.

Now you'll see a similar setup as before with a ship, but there's a big glass window blocking the way across.  Now I know what you're thinking.  Get on the ship, pull out the shotgun, then as you get close blast it into an explosion of glass that falls around you as glide through the opening on your dark chariot (and your neat freaks that were the orb bearers cringe at the huge mess).

*That would be so awesome*

But no, you need to have 2 people stand on the platforms to the right and the left to make the glass disappear.  Speaking of that, why this plate on the right, plate on the left crap?  You see how well that worked for Aethon and Crota.  Why not put plate on the ceiling? Worse case scenario the Guardians coming after you have some mild concussions.

But standing on the plates does one other thing.  Up on the left hand side wall there's a door that just opened.  I know you can't see it, but it's there.  Trust me.  See that diagonal line going up the left hand side?  That's your path.

So here's how you get there.  When the ship approaches the entry way, jump off the left hand side towards the wall attempting to land on the little path.  Then you bounce off the wall and fall into the chasm.  So you try again, and you land on the path, but you bounce off that and fall into the chasm.  Then you try again and just miss.  At this point, you're pretty sure I'm messing with you.  But then, you see your fellow Guardian walk up that path.  You know, the Guardian who read the next paragraph.  

OK, jumping to the path doesn't work unless you do it *just* right.   So screw that.  See that little protrusion coming towards you on the lower left?  Jump on **that**.  From there, it's an easy jump onto the wall and up the path.  Hunters, the Bones are really good here as well to make any adjustments you need.  Warlocks can just hover into their in the right spot.  Titans, make sure you have Better Control on your jumping so you don't go right over.

What awaits you at the top?  *A Chest!!!*  Go ahead and claim your prize.

**Q: WTF?! More shards?**

**A:** I'm surprised you didn't see that coming.

Go ahead and jump to the other side. There are a few baddies, and a shrieker in the central corridor.  The best time to kill the shrieker is right when another Guardian is crossing over, then running towards them so they take the brunt of the revenge blast.  After all, that's what teamwork is all about!

There are plates here, but if you don't think your fireteam is deserving of shards, go ahead through the cooridor and up the elevator, eventually you'll hit a door and pull everyone forward.  Otherwise, if you're trying to get brownie points, step on a plate so the people can get their shards and cross over.  Make sure to mutter "c'mon c'mon" softly under your breath. You have places to go, and bosses to kill.

For those of you collecting Calcified Fragments, there's one on the pillar in the central cooridor before the elevator.

Who's ready for more exercise?  It's time for the [relay race](./relayrace.html)!
