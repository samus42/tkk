# Battleborn Taken King Guide
## The Warpriest (Challenge Mode)

All right! By entering this page you have taken on the mantle of a Super Guardian.  Someone who wants to go above and beyond the standard hard mode raid.  Someone who likes to live on the edge!

And probably most importantly, someone who wants a 320 relic & item.

Just keeping it real.

So what is this grand challenge?  What trial awaits you?  You must................**Kill the Warpriest without anyone holding the Aura twice.**

Yeah, I know.  Anti-climatic.  I tried.

If your light level is high enough to kill the Warpriest in two rounds, this is pretty easy.  *The biggest rule to follow is if you are the Aura holder, don't die.*  Most of the failures of this challenge are due to the Aura holder dying and the Aura being "randomly" assigned to someone who has held it before.  

Please note the "air quotes" around "randomly".  I don't believe it for a minute.  So don't die.

Seriously, the best way to prepare this is to communicate what's going to happen in the worst case scenario of the same plate being the Aura plate 3 times in a row.  The "random" assignment seems to favor the right & center plates, so people on the left be prepared to come take a plate if needed.  As rounds progress, Weapons Bubble isn't as critical so the Titan can take the 3rd plate and just skip throwing the bubble up.

If you talk, you'll win.  If you don't, you'll die.

Now [on to the maze!](./golgorathmaze.html)
